# memory-game-project

This was my first ever project that was made with html css and javascript. 

I got the idea for this game from the youtube channel "freecodecamp.org". They had a tutorial on how to make it, so i decided to try to do it on my own, and then compare my code with theirs for better learning. 

The project is a classical memory game (in wich i choose the theme to be animals), and must work the following way:

- The game elements are a set of cards in wich every card has a pair that's identical to it
- Every card has on its face an unique image, thats identical only to its pair 
- The game starts by placing all the cards facing down, so that you cant see the content, and shuffling the set of cards in a ramdom order 
- The player can choose two cards facing down, if the two cards are identical, the player scores a point, and the cards keep facing up until the game ends
- If the cards selected are not identical, the cards must turn facing down again
- The game ends when all the cards are facing up

Since this was my first project, it has A LOT of room to improvement. I will probably refactor it soon, or keep it like it is to keep the remembrance of how i started, and how my continuing progress is going.
